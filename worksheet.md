# Task 1


Take a look at the two repositories:


* (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
* (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler


And answer the following questions about them:


* These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites? What service do they provide? Which is better?
These sites have version control, manage code and allow collaboration. Both are fairly similar but github revolves around public code and being an open source, while gitbucket is mainly for businesses and is private.


* Who made the last commit to repository A?
Matthew Roberts


* Who made the first commit to repository A?
Jon Mountjoy


* Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
Dave Pearce


* Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
Both projects are inactive at the moment as there has been no recent activity or commits, this may have been from the project being dropped or finished.


* ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
A (Gitbucket): status --> libertinus OR data
B (Github): lib


# Task 2


The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it. It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.


You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method. Try them out. You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"


Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
